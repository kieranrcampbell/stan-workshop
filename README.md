## Pre-requisites

### Knowledge

You should be familiar with the basic workings of R.

You should also have read about Bayesian Statistics as part of the pre-course exercise and be familiar with the following concepts:

- a random variable
- the basic rules of probability 
- a probability distribution
- Bayes' Rule
- prior probability distributions
- likelihood function
- posterior probability distribution

The mechanics of actually doing Bayesian inference is *not* required as this is the focus of the workshop practicals.

### Hardware and Software

Your own laptop with a copy of R and Rstudio (or your preferred development environment) installed.

Please install the following R packages:

- ggplot2
- Rstan
- devtools
